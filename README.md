# Robot Fighting Online - A Fight My Monster Clone
Fight My Monster was a strategic card game developed in 2009 by Dominic Williams. The game was eventually abandoned in 2016, when the games website was taken down without any warning, nor an indication.

Robot Fighting Online is an attempt to create a similar online game to Fight My Monster. Some things will be the same, some will be different (mainly due to copyright).

Unfortunately, the original developer, Sanmatch, had a data loss and decided to release the project because he felt that because he was on his own, it would take too long to develop. Fortunately, I was able to help out with making the project Open-Source.

As of 24th August 2020, I have decided to archive this repository due to inactivity.
