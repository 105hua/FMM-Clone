# Robots Fighting Online - A Fight My Monster Clone
Fight My Monster was a strategic card game that was developed in 2009 by Dominic Williams. The game was eventually abandoned in 2016 because no one was willing to maintain the game and Dominic wanted to work on other projects, like DFINITY. At the time of the shutdown, the FMM Community wasn't happy with this decision, as the shutdown came with no warning or even an indication.

Robot Fighting Online was an attempt to create a similar online game to Fight My Monster. The game was planned to have a few features that were different to the original game to avoid any copyright issues.

In early 2020, the games sole developer, Sanmatch, had a data loss and decided to release the source code for Robot Fighting Online, as he no longer had the motivation to continue working on the game and it would simply take too long to develop on his own. In light of this, I have decided to upload the source code to GitHub in case Sanmatch, or anyone else, decides to resume development on the game one day.

As of November 2020, no further work has been done on the development of Robot Fighting Online since the data loss and because of this, I have made the decision to archive this repository until further notice.
